A full-stack web application for playing the game Mancala that I made during my traineeship at Sogyo. This project is based on a provided template.
The things that were provided:
- Project setup
- Most of the API module
- Some beginnings of the client module (start page and general layout)
- Interfaces for the domain
The things that I made:
- (Java) Domain and implementations of the interfaces
- (Java) Extra API endpoints
- (React/Typescript) Most components, services and pages
